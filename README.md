#Crafting Calculator vAlpha

## Supports (Eventually):

- Recursive crafting
- Multiple recipes (must manually select a recipe to use though, give me a break I'm not going to read your mind)
- Chance outputs


## Features I want:
- Ability to rip recipes, item names, and icons from game
- GUI to do crafting calculations
- Minecraft version independence
- Portability
